# Space Food
A simple experimental game exploring the `PixiJS` library. The 'final product' is a game where the player gets to be a square-shaped alien creature flying around space to eat food. The project plays around with a custom (though simple) physics engine that simulates acceleration in a zero-gravity environment.

I am currently exploring a number of different libraries with the prospects of making a more refined physics/gravity-based game. My goal with this experiment was to design many iterations of a basic physics/gravity simulator so the code is quite dense (e.g. all of my scripts are written directly into the HTML file; yikes!) and I lamentably commented out all of my unused ideas instead of organizing them better.

### Gameplay
Use WASD to move. Pilot the creature over food to 'eat' it. There is a score counter at the top of the screen. Touching the edges of the game panel resets the game.
